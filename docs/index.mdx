## Welcome to context-window

Building AI applications that answer questions from your documents shouldn't be complicated. **context-window** provides a simple, elegant API that handles the entire RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

## Key Features

### Strict RAG - No Hallucinations

Unlike general chat models, context-window only answers from YOUR documents. If the answer isn't found, it says "I don't know based on the uploaded files."

### Idempotent Ingestion

Re-running ingestion with the same files won't create duplicates. Chunk IDs are content-based and stable, making updates safe and predictable.

### Source Citations

Every answer includes references to the source documents used, making it easy to verify information and maintain trust.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { createContextWindow } from "context-window";

const cw = await createContextWindow({
  indexName: "my-docs",
  data: ["./documents"],
  ai: { provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o-mini" },
  vectorStore: { provider: "pinecone" }
});

const { text, sources } = await cw.ask("What is the main topic?");
console.log(text);     // AI-generated answer
console.log(sources);  // ["document1.pdf", "notes.md"]
```
